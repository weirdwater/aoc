# Python

* To read each line of a file as a string, use `with open (filename) as file:`
* When reading each line in a file using `open` return characters can be stripped using `string.strip()` 
* To parse an int, use `int()`
* To get the index number of an list item, use enumerate to get the list's entries `tuple[int,a]`
* `list.sort()` is a mutable operation
* To get a subset of a list, use a range selector in the index selector: [0:5]
